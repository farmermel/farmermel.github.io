      <!-- Main content area -->
      <div id="main">
        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>My parents work so I have some projects going to kill time while they're out.</p>

        <h3>Disemboweling Toys</h3>
        <p>My toys are pretty mean to my friend Nymeria, so I'm slowly
        relieving them of their insides. It takes a lot of work because
        mom is no cheapskate so they're all p high quality. Still, many waves
        will turn a mountain into a beach of sand.</p>

        <h3>Sunscreen Tasting Profile Guide</h3>
        <p>Other mom buys pretty nice sunscreen but she never actually eats it!
        I think because she doesn't know which ones taste best. I'm working on figuring
        that out for her so she doesn't have to be so shy about it. I'm three in and so far
        I really like the tang of the Neutrogena.</p>

        <h3>Practicing Tricks</h3>
        <p>I know a lot of tricks because I'm pretty smart but even the best dogs must
        practice. Sometimes I use my alone time to practice the harder things like "wait"
        "leave it". I've still got some work to do.

        <h2 id="fun-facts">Fun Facts</h2>

        <p>Besides the useful stuff, I like wiling away the hours playing with the cat.
        I think she really enjoys our time together too.</p>

        <h3>I Like Men</h3>
        <p>Even though I've got two moms I like men better than women. Here's why:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have you met Patrick? He chases me and hugs me and howls with me.</li>
          <li>Have you met Cody? He mostly ignores me, which I find very compelling. What's going on with
          that man? I intend to find out.</li>
          <li>Have you met Other Mom's dad? I haven't but I hope to if he ever visits.
          He sounds cool.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>I Like Women Too Though</h3>
        <p>When it comes down to it I like attention no matter what and women are pretty great too.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mom is great in too many ways to say here.</li>
          <li>Other mom is also great. Probably doable to say here but who's got time?</li>
          <li>Also great: Casey, and the Bach gang.</li>
          <li> I feel I should mention here that the other men of the Bach gang are great too.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
        <h3>There's so much to know about me apparently</h3>
        <p>Just so many lists.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What do you want from me I'm a dog</li>
          <li>When it comes right down to it I can only do so many things in a day</li>
          <li>Squirrel?!?!</li>
        </ul>
